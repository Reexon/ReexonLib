/**
 * MD5 is a hashing algorithm that takes a message of up to 264 bits and reduces it to a digest of 128 bits (16 bytes).
 * 
 * The algorithm is a development of the MD4 algorithm invented by Ronald Rivest and announced in 1990. Unfortunately, 
 * MD4 was flawed, so Rivest made some revisions, and the resulting algorithm was christened MD5.
 * 
 * Any hashing (or digest) algorithm should be such that, given a digest and the corresponding message from which it was derived, 
 * it should be computationally infeasible to construct a different message with the same digest.
